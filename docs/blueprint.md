## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: RIT Orange (#F26900), a vibrant and recognizable hue associated with the university. This color embodies energy and enthusiasm.
- Background color: A light, desaturated shade of RIT Orange (#F8E9DD). This will provide a warm, inviting backdrop without overwhelming the interface.
- Accent color: A complementary blue (#3185FC), positioned about 30 degrees to the left on the color wheel, provides a vivid contrast against the RIT Orange. It's ideal for calls to action and interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif), to ensure a modern, neutral look, so the text is comfortable and machine-objective to read. It is great for both body text and headlines, without overwhelming amounts of character or vintage-look detail.
- Use simple, clean icons from a set like Material Design Icons to represent resource categories and user actions, making the interface intuitive and easy to navigate.
- Use a clean, grid-based layout for consistent spacing and alignment. Prioritize key information by using visual hierarchy, making it easy for users to scan and find what they need quickly.
- Incorporate subtle animations, such as fade-ins, transitions, and loading indicators, to enhance the user experience without being distracting.
