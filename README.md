# TigerSource
This is an open-source repository designed to help RIT students find the resources they need for a given task, as well as to look for clubs. Tigersource has no affiliation with RIT.

## Quickstart
Get a Google Gemini API key, create a `.env` file in the `/functions` directory, and set `GEMINI_API_KEY=[Your key]`.<br>
To get started, run `npm i` followed by `npm run emulate`.

## Note:
More RIT apps should be open-source so RIT computer science or UI/UX students can fork them and learn from them. I know some use external services like Starfish or Symplicity, but the mobile app and CampusGroups, for example, could have open source code.
