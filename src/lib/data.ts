And it’s also not true to say that the only people who understand basketball are the ones who play it.There are a lot of students who may not have skills to play the game on the highest level, but have the brains to understand it. Our campus is full of intelligent students who can offer fresh perspectives on basketball insights. Providing RIT’s bright minds with access to basketball statistics not only helps players and coaches make better decisions on the court, but also gives students hands-on analytical experience in a field they’re truly interested in.We want to help every student grow as analytical thinkers not only in basketball, but in any challenge they may face. By understanding fundamental concepts and learning how to break down complex problems, we believe individuals will be ready for whatever obstacles come their way. If basketball can serve as a model for exploring how to approach these challenges, our potential to learn and excel truly becomes limitless.Establishing a basketball analytics club creates a beneficial environment for everyone. We can support both the men’s and women’s basketball teams by building detailed scouting reports and offering thorough player evaluations. Which may ultimately help them win more games. At the same time, our students will gain experience by working on hands-on projects they can showcase in an online portfolio, boosting their resumes and professional profiles.",

Every major and walk of life has a place on this team. Even more importantly, our amazing and welcoming upperclassmen will teach you any skill that you want to explore! This includes riding snowmobiles! . Our team places a large emphasis on modifying existing snowmobiles to run cleaner while maintaining the performance that the power sports industry offers. Reaching this goal involves improving fuel economy, reducing emissions, and lowering noise pollution. These modifications must also be done with the snowmobile industry in mind, meaning maintaining performance, handling, and cost. All this preparation is for our annual competition where we face off against over a dozen other universities in different dynamic and static events. The dynamic events test the capabilities of the snowmobile and include acceleration, cold start, endurance / fuel economy, noise testing, emissions, and handling. The static events include a technical design paper and presentation, and defending industry impact through value benefit and sales presentations. In short: we improve the impact snowmobiles have on the environment while keeping them fun to ride!We all hope that you can come join us in building one of the world’s first plug-in hybrid snowmobiles and learn alongside us on this adventure! If you have any questions about the team, feel free to email us at cleansnow@rit.edu or DM us on Instagram!Participants modify existing snowmobiles to be cleaner. That involves improving fuel economy, reducing emissions, and lowering noise pollution, all while maintaining the performance that the power sports industry offers. Teams will compete in various events, including dynamic events, such as acceleration, cold start, endurance/fuel economy, noise testing, emissions, and handling.

These include a technical design paper and presentation, a value benefit presentation, and a sale presentation.

We apply ideas from fields ranging from economics to psychology to ethics, to try and solve them.Effective Altruism is based on the idea that while helping others is good, not all forms of this are equal, and it is morally imperative to use evidence and reason to do good in the best ways possible. This is usually focused on charitable giving, but also relates to career choice, politics, and consumer decisions as well.While giving your time and resources to one good cause versus another may feel the same to you, there can be a difference in impact on the scale of hundreds or even thousands for some uses versus others.The biggest specific subareas of interest within Effective Altruism are global health and development, factory farming, and the long term future.",

The first is they can participate as a \"general member\" – attending council meetings and participating in activates/events put on by Council. The other is to take more of a leadership role and hold a position on the executive board, which consists of a president, vice president, event coordinator, and secretary. SOIS's Student Government (SG) Senator Representative also participates on the student council e-board. The SOIS E-Board role is to organize and implement one event each semester (fall and spring), as well as host an exhibit at Imagine RIT. The Student Council e-board members are responsible for attending admissions events, such as new student and transfer student open houses, orientation, as well other campus events where they can explain their perspective on the interdisciplinary nature of a SOIS degree program. In addition, this group serves as a sounding board for SOIS faculty and staff looking for student perspective feedback. OBJECTIVES•\tFacilitate and maintain a sense of community within the SOIS student body where any RIT student can converse about School of Individualized Study related topics•\tProvide students assistance with their academic goals and career path•\tLobby for SOIS position on student government•\tProvide a medium for students to socialize with other students who have the same interests •\tPartner with other organizations to increase knowledge of the council's presence on campusNew members are always welcome to join in and participate in student council at any point in the semester.
